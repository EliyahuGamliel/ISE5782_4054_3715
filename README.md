Welcome to the Mini Project Introduction to Software Engineering! <br/>
The project creates images with basic shapes and even supports obj files of complex 3D bodies.

<b>We made two improvements in terms of image:</b> <br/>
1. Anti Anlising <br/>
2. Soft Shadow <br/>

<b>And we made two improvements in terms of system performance:</b> <br/>
1. Multi-threading <br />
2. Adaptive supersampling <br/>
3. Bounding Volume Hierarchy <br/>

<b>Features:</b> <br />
1. You can track the rate of rendering progress during image rendering
2. Complex 3D models can be added and will be displayed in the image
